## A computer’s functions can be broken down into three basic tasks:
> Input: A user types the letter ‘A’ on the keyboard, which results in sending a code representing the
letter ‘A’ to the computer

>Processing: The computer’s CPU determines what letter was typed by looking up the keyboard code
in a table

> Output: The CPU sends instructions to the graphics cards to display the letter ‘A’, which is then sent to
the computer monitor

- Two types of memory:
Short term memory (RAM) and long term memory (ROM)

  - RAM is volatile, meaning that it loses its contents when the power is turned off.

  - ROM is non-volatile, meaning that it retains its contents when the power is turned off.

RAM are non volatile, meaning that they retain their contents when the power is turned off. 

If there is not enough RAM, the computer will use the hard drive as virtual memory. This is called paging.

They will transfer from the hard drive to the RAM when the computer is turned on.

When its not needed, it will be transfered back to the hard drive.

RAM is used to store the operating system, which is a program that is run when the computer is turned on.

---------------------------

ROM are volatile, meaning that they lose their contents when the power is turned off.

ROM are used to store the BIOS, which is a program that is run when the computer is turned on.
